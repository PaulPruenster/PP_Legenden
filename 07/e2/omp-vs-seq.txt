The sequential solution is slower thant the omp-vectoriced version.
The differece is a little under double the time.

The solutions are both the same so the computation is correct from the omp version.

The performance is verified by the perf-tool.

float-double:
Now the time of the sequential solution is way faster.

e1 vs e2: 
When comparing e1 and e2 -- we can see that both implementations have
the same execution time.
