This exercise deals with performance analysis and improvement of a given code.
The program reads a matrix size n from the command-line.
Then two square matrices a and b of size n*n are filled with random numbers.
Finally, the program should print the sum of all elements of matrix c and the wall clock time after the matrix multiplication c=a*b was conducted.
