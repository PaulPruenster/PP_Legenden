We get the following output for each of the programs:

array.sh:
18,943,442      cache-references:u                                          
15,462,970      cache-misses:u 

bufferarray.sh:
35,497,548      cache-references:u                                          
18,819,504      cache-misses:u

localsum.sh:
28,221      cache-references:u                                          
1,468       cache-misses:u


We can see that the localsum-version is the version that uses the cache least, but also has the least cache misses (can also depend on the 
small amount of general cache references). The array.sh and bufferarray.sh version look kinda the same, but the bufferarray-version has fewer misses!
