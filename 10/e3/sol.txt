To determine the distance and direction vectors for each iteration of the given code snippet, we need to analyze the values of i and j within the nested loops.

Iteration 1:

    i = 0, j = 1
    Distance vector: [2, 0]
    Direction vector: [1, -1]

Iteration 2:

    i = 0, j = 2
    Distance vector: [2, 1]
    Direction vector: [1, -1]

Iteration 3:

    i = 0, j = 3
    Distance vector: [2, 2]
    Direction vector: [1, -1]

Iteration 4:

    i = 1, j = 1
    Distance vector: [3, 0]
    Direction vector: [1, -1]

Iteration 5:

    i = 1, j = 2
    Distance vector: [3, 1]
    Direction vector: [1, -1]

Iteration 6:

    i = 1, j = 3
    Distance vector: [3, 2]
    Direction vector: [1, -1]

Iteration 7:

    i = 2, j = 1
    Distance vector: [4, 0]
    Direction vector: [1, -1]

Iteration 8:

    i = 2, j = 2
    Distance vector: [4, 1]
    Direction vector: [1, -1]

Iteration 9:

    i = 2, j = 3
    Distance vector: [4, 2]
    Direction vector: [1, -1]

Iteration 10:

    i = 3, j = 1
    Distance vector: [5, 0]
    Direction vector: [1, -1]

Iteration 11:

    i = 3, j = 2
    Distance vector: [5, 1]
    Direction vector: [1, -1]

Iteration 12:

    i = 3, j = 3
    Distance vector: [5, 2]
    Direction vector: [1, -1]

The type of dependence represented in this code snippet is an output dependence. Each iteration writes to the same array element a[i + 2][j - 1], potentially causing conflicts if executed concurrently.
