1) What should happen:

The program creates 2 variables and then 2 threads, in one it sets the variavles to
some values and in the other thread there is a loop that waits until the flag var is
set and then prints the data var. So it should always print 42 as data is set before
the flag in the first thread.

2) Compile and run in a loop of 1000:

salloc --exclusive --tasks-per-node=1 --cpus-per-task=1 srun --pty bash
then run ./test.sh

Sometimes there is a deadlock (?)

3) Is any #pragma omp flush required:
