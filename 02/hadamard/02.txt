In this exercise we had to find the difference in cache management and how this can affect programs, like the different implementations of the 
Hamdard-product. We have a 4-way-set-associative cache. This means that the cache is divided into sets, and each memory address maps to a specific set. 
The "4-way" part of the name means that there are four cache lines (or blocks) in each set.

Now assuming that all variables are initialized properly and our matrices stored in contiguous memory and in row-major order, we want to find
out how the matrix size "n" and the line size "s" influence eachother.

We can look at our demo file with the LRU algorithm to understand this:
Whenever we need to load a new cache line, this is called a "cache miss". If it already is in the cache, we have a cache hit!

We can find a formula by finding the probability of a cache miss per matrix-entry `times` the size of the matrix.

We simulated this with the hadamard_demo-program.

we can try using cachegrind, but are getting nearly the same results for both programs. (Same for perf)
